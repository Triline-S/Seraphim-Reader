# Seraphim Reader

Reader for music scores intended for organists.
Designed and best used on tablets in portrait mode.

## How to use

### Tabs overview

1. Accept the app's access to images on your devices.
2. After you accept, you'll see an empty search tab. It's your **proprium** tab, and you can fill it up with your own scores.
   To do so, in the directory of your scores (`your_documents_directory/Scores` by default) create folders like in the given example:
- Proprium
  - Score1
    - F01.jpg
    - F02.jpg
  - Score2
    - F01.jpg
    - C01.jpg
(We'll get to what those filenames mean in a while.)
3. The middle tab is the **Ordinarium** tab. It's prefilled with the general flow of a catholic mass. In your scores directory create those folders:
- Ordinarium
  - Amen Simplex
  - Amen Solemnis
  - Verbum Domini
  - Prefacja
  - Przeistoczenie
  - Kyrie
  - Gloria
  - Sanctus
  - Pater Noster
  - Agnus Dei
  - Koniec
4. The last tab is the settings. You can change a few things here.
